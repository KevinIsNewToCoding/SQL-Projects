Recursive CTEs:

How would you use a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to find all employees in a company hierarchy who report directly or indirectly to a particular manager?
Window Functions:

Can you write a query using window functions to calculate a running total of sales for each day, partitioned by each product, while also resetting the total at the beginning of each month?
Query Optimization:

Given a complex query with multiple joins, how would you go about optimizing its performance? What techniques or indexes would you consider, and why?
Dynamic SQL:

How would you write a dynamic SQL query that generates a pivot table based on data from a column that you specify at runtime?
Nested Subqueries:

Can you create a query that returns the top three employees with the highest sales in each department, using a correlated subquery?
JSON Manipulation:

How would you extract and manipulate data from a JSON column in MySQL? Can you write a query to filter rows based on a specific value within the JSON data?
Advanced Joins:

How would you perform a full outer join in MySQL, which does not natively support this operation? Can you provide an alternative query?
Indexing Strategy:

How would you determine the best indexing strategy for a table with millions of rows where queries often filter by a combination of columns with different data types?
Stored Procedures:

How would you write a stored procedure that accepts a list of product IDs and returns the total sales for each product in the list? How would you handle cases where some IDs might not exist in the database?
Handling NULLs:

How would you write a query to replace NULL values with the previous non-NULL value within a partition, assuming you are working with ordered data
